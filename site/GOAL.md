# Goal

Build a simple web application that identifies users without a login.

# Specifications

Assign each of the user id with a funny name like 'Vibe Genius' or 'Pickled Teddy' and a background & a main color.

This is all saved in the zero-auth/ collection in firebase.

And use that data to display the text & background of the task.
